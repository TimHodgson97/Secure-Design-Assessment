# Secure-Design-Assessment
This is the README for the web app for Secure Design.

To view and iteract with webapp all files can be cloned from the repository. The main.py file must be run and the url that it launches can be used to access the website. In order to give the examiner access and allow the website to be checked there is a Sign Up page that will allow the user to sign up a new account, using an email address (doesn't have to be real, so 1234@gmail.com will work) and a password which must be at least 10 digits and contain at least one number. This Sign Up page would be monitored and require authorisation by an administrator for the fully functional design. Users cannot edit or delete any entries on the page but their own.
